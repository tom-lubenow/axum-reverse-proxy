Below is a (rather opinionated) review of your middleware’s API, correctness, structure, and potential performance considerations. Overall, it looks like a good start at implementing the main points of RFC 9110, but there are certainly some places that could be tweaked or refactored. I’ve tried to highlight both conceptual and more nitty‐gritty implementation details.

## 1. API & Layering

### 1.1. Single Monolithic Layer vs. Multiple Layers

Right now this is one big layer that does several things:

1. Loop detection  
2. `Max-Forwards` processing  
3. Connection header & hop-by-hop header removal  
4. Via header manipulation (both request and response)  
5. End-to-end header preservation

Conceptually, it might be clearer—and easier to maintain/test—if each of these behaviors were broken out into smaller, composable layers. For example:

- **Layer A**: Hop-by-hop header removal  
- **Layer B**: `Max-Forwards` handling  
- **Layer C**: Via header insertion  
- **Layer D**: Loop detection  

Then you can combine them in a `ServiceBuilder` or your own custom layering:

```rust
let service = ServiceBuilder::new()
    .layer(HopByHopRemovalLayer::new())
    .layer(MaxForwardsLayer::new())
    .layer(ViaLayer::new(...))
    .layer(LoopDetectionLayer::new(...))
    .service(inner_service);
```

**Pros**:

- Each piece is individually testable (e.g., a dedicated test for HopByHopRemoval).  
- If you discover a corner case or performance issue in one chunk, it’s easier to swap out or fix that chunk without disturbing the others.  
- If some users don’t care about (or want) `Max-Forwards` processing, they could simply leave out that layer.

**Cons**:

- Some overhead from multiple layers (extra calls to `poll_ready` and some function-call indirection).  
- Possibly some repeated scanning of headers, though you can do single-pass solutions if you carefully unify them.

Given that you mentioned caring a lot about performance, a single pass over the headers might be more performant, so a single monolithic layer can be more optimal. That said, splitting it out for clarity is often worthwhile, and if your traffic is not extremely high or the overhead is small, clarity tends to be the bigger win.

### 1.2. In-Place vs. “Preserve and Reinsert” Approach

One pattern you have is to:

1. Remove or decrement certain headers in the request.
2. Forward the request.
3. Reinsert original “end-to-end” headers in the response.

From an API perspective, I might ask: Do you truly need to reinsert all the end-to-end headers back into the response? Some proxies only preserve certain crucial headers (like `Authorization` if acting as a forward proxy, or certain unconditional end-to-end headers) rather than blindly copying them back. Blindly copying them can cause issues if the upstream service sets or modifies a header itself. Also, if you reinsert them, do you risk collisions (e.g., a header that you reinsert might conflict with a header the backend has set)?

At the very least, you could store only a subset of “interesting” or “sensitive” headers rather than all of them. For example, if your primary reason is to ensure certain end-to-end security headers are carried forward, you can store just those.

## 2. Correctness & RFC9110 Semantics

### 2.1. Hop-by-Hop Header Removal Nuances

RFC9110 (and older RFC7230) define a list of hop-by-hop headers, but there’s also a nuance for `TE`: the only acceptable value in `TE` for an HTTP/1.1 request is `trailers`. If `TE: trailers` is present, it’s actually allowed as end-to-end. The RFC states that if any value other than `trailers` is present, it must be removed. The relevant text (Section [7.6.1.2 in RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-7.6.1.2)) says:

> A proxy that receives a TE header field containing any transfer-codings other than “trailers” MUST remove them.

Right now, your code unconditionally removes `TE` (as part of the standard hop-by-hop list), which is on the safer side but not strictly correct for the legitimate `trailers` usage. If strict compliance is desired, you’d want a check:

```rust
if let Some(te) = headers.get(http::header::TE) {
    if let Ok(te_str) = te.to_str() {
        // If `te_str` contains anything other than "trailers", remove it
        // else keep it if it's only "trailers".
    }
}
```

Similarly, for the response, you might remove any TE except `trailers`, though typically responses don’t carry TE in the same manner as requests do.

### 2.2. Via Header Behavior

- **Combining Vs. Not Combining**. You have a config option `combine_via`. The RFC does allow combining entries, but watch out for corner cases. For instance, if there are multiple protocol versions in a single `Via`, you can’t unify them trivially.  
- **Firewall Mode**. You mention a “firewall mode” that uses a single “1.1 firewall” entry. That’s valid from a security standpoint, but it does lose the traceability the RFC tries to preserve. If that’s your desired behavior, then it’s fine.

One subtlety is that if you’re combining `Via` entries, you need to parse them carefully and reconstruct them. In many proxies, a simpler approach is to just append your “1.1 pseudonym” entry, leaving the others alone. This is a simpler logic:

1. Take existing `Via` header string.  
2. Append “, 1.1 MyProxyName”.  
3. Set that as the new `Via`.

This is guaranteed to keep the chain unbroken. Right now your code tries to parse them into `ViaEntry` structs and then group them, which is okay but can be overkill. Also, if you want to strictly follow the grammar for combining them (including optional port, optional comment, etc.), you’ll need a more thorough parser or rely on existing crates.

### 2.3. Loop Detection Heuristics

- Checking the request’s `Host` against `server_names` is a minimal approach. In real-world scenarios, loop detection can also rely on `Forwarded` or `X-Forwarded-For` or on repeated `Via` entries.  
- Right now, your code checks if `config.pseudonym` was re-encountered in the `Via` chain. That is one legitimate approach, but it might fail if the user changes the `pseudonym` config mid-run or if the proxy is behind a load balancer that changes the host. Some proxies also track a unique “via token” or even a “request id” that they look for.  
- Still, for a general “we appear in the chain, so we must have looped” approach, this is fine.

### 2.4. `Max-Forwards` on Methods Other Than TRACE/OPTIONS?

Per RFC9110 Section [7.6.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-7.6.2), `Max-Forwards` is *primarily* used with TRACE and OPTIONS, which your code respects. That part seems correct. Just be mindful that other proxies or services might use `Max-Forwards` in nonstandard ways. You’re ignoring it for methods other than TRACE/OPTIONS, which is consistent with the RFC’s typical usage.

### 2.5. Echoing the Request in TRACE (Body Handling)

When `Max-Forwards == 0` on a `TRACE` request, you do:

```rust
*response.body_mut() = Body::from(format!("{:?}", request));
```

The RFC says a `TRACE` response **SHOULD** reflect the received request, but typically proxies reflect **the exact message** (headers + body) in a single textual format. If you’re using `{:?}`, you’ll get Rust’s debug format. Some clients might want an HTTP-style echo. For minimal compliance, though, simply returning *some* representation of the received request is enough. Just be aware that some clients or tools might expect a more canonical echo.

## 3. Performance Considerations

### 3.1. Header Cloning, Parsing, & Rebuilding

1. You clone the entire set of request headers into `preserved_headers` for re-insertion in the response. That might be expensive in high-volume scenarios—especially if there are lots of large headers. Do you really need them all?  
2. You do multiple passes over the header map for different operations:
   - Determining which headers to remove  
   - Possibly parsing them (for example, `Via`)  
   - Cloning them for reinsert

   You can (if you want maximum performance) do a single pass that decides for each header if you keep it, remove it, or transform it, in place. That can reduce overhead but makes the code more complex.

### 3.2. Minimizing Allocations

- Splitting and parsing the `Via` header can involve a fair amount of small allocations (`String` creation, vector expansions, etc.). For most real-world cases, that overhead is not huge compared to the cost of network I/O, TLS, etc. But if you really want to optimize, you might consider using a specialized parser or reusing a buffer.  
- The same goes for your use of `Box::pin(...)`; typically it’s an acceptable overhead for most Rust async services, but you can consider alternatives if you want zero allocations in your future. (Often not worth it in practice, but just noting.)

### 3.3. Single vs. Multiple Layers Revisited

As mentioned, a single layer can do one pass over the headers to remove hop-by-hop, handle `Via`, do loop detection, etc. That’s probably slightly more optimal at runtime. However, it comes at the cost of code complexity. For big systems that can do tens of thousands of requests per second, the small differences might matter. For more moderate traffic, it might not justify losing clarity.

## 4. Summary of Potential Improvements

1. **Consider splitting the logic into smaller layers** for clarity and modular testing, *unless* you genuinely need the micro-optimizations from a single pass.  
2. **Refine `TE` handling** so that `"trailers"` is not removed if you want to be strictly RFC-compliant.  
3. **Re-check the logic for “firewall” vs. “combine” modes**. Possibly simpler to always append `Via` rather than group them, unless your use case truly requires grouping.  
4. **Be mindful about preserving end-to-end headers**. Blindly copying them back into the response can cause collisions or unexpected overwrites. Consider only preserving the ones that matter, or do so carefully.  
5. **Consider the overhead** of repeatedly parsing/cloning headers. If you’re aiming for high throughput, you might want a single pass. If correctness/clarity is more important, the current approach is fine.  
6. **TRACE echo**. If you want to be more faithful to RFC “echo the message” semantics, consider returning a plaintext representation of the request line + headers + body. Or keep it simple as you have it.

Overall, your code is definitely a good start and covers the main points of RFC9110 compliance. It’s “correct enough” for many real-world proxy scenarios—there’s no glaring “this is entirely broken” thing. Most of the concerns are about subtle compliance edge-cases, performance nuances, or architectural clarity. If your primary concern is that you are basically implementing the RFC’s musts/shoulds, you’re in pretty good shape.
